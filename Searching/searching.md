# Searching Algorithms
**Searching algorithms** are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.
> based on the type of search operations these algorithms are classified into two categories
- Sequential Search, In this the list of array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. for example **Linear Search**
- Interval Search, These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data structures, these type of search algorithms are much
  more effecient than Linear search as they repeatedly target the center of the search data structure and devide the search space in half. for example **Binary Search**
