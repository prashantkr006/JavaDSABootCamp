/*Introduction to wrapper classes
-> Wrapper classes makes primitives into an object
    example: int num = 10; // here num is a primitive variable
    it can be changed into an object by the help of Wrapper class
    -> Integer num = new Integer (10); // wrapper class
    now num will act as an object.
